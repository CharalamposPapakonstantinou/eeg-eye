# EEG | Eye state

EEG signals are used for eye state prediction by the implementation of a random forest classifier.
PCA is used for reducing the multidimensionality of the data.








## Run

Either drap & drop eye.csv into Maltab command window or 
execute the matlab code that uses the .mat file.

The output of the matlab code is the eyepca.xlsx file with the principal components
which is used as an input for the python code.
